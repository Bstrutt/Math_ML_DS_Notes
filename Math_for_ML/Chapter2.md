As previously stated, I have a good knowledge of this subject but for the sake of 
consolidating that knowledge and aiming it towards machine learning I will be 
covering it again here.

# Linear Algebra

* Vectors
  * A vector is an object which can be added with another vector or multiplied by some scalar,
    in both cases the result is another vector.
  * We generally think of vectors as n-tuples of real numbers
* Closure 
  * Defined vaguely in this text in the form of a question
  * "The set of all things that can result from my proposed operations"
  * In terms of vectors the result is a vector space

### Systems of Linear Equations
* Can formulate problems as systems of linear equations
* We can solve these systems to get solutions to our problems
* For real-valued systems we obtain 1, 0, or infinite solutions
* A systematic approach to solving SoLE is within the book
  * This approach boils down to making vectors out of coefficient columns
    then making a matrix out of these. Afterwards we make a vector out of 
    the variables and matrix multiply these equalling the product vector.
  * Contained on page 22 for reference
### Matrices
* A matrix A is an m*n tuple of elements
* Elements can be located using a coordinate scheme ie. A<sub>12</sub>
