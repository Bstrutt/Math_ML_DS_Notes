I've never approached this subject, or at least this subject under this name. My hope is
that I can move through it with haste so that I can get to more practical machine learning
techniques.
# Analytic Geometry
Adding geometric interpretation to the concepts of linear algebra.
Inner products, norms, and metrics are used to develop support vector machines later.

### Norms
* Norm defined as a function that assigns lengths to vectors such that these hold
  * Absolutely Homogenous: ||*theta*x||=|*theta*|||x||
  * Triangle Inequality: ||x+y|| <= ||x||+||Y||
  * Positive Definite: ||x|| >= 0 and ||x|| = 0 <=> x = 0
### Inner Products
