### Chatper 1, Introduction

Three core concepts
* Data
  * The goal is to design methodolgies to extract valuable patterns from 
  data without domain specific knowledge. Data is the source. 
  * Can be thought of as vectors because they are numerically representable.
* Model
  * Designed to achieve the goal of extracting patterns. Models are the means. 
  Said to learn from data if its performance on a task improves after taking 
  data into account. 
  * Good models are simplified version of real data sets which can capture relevant 
  details and show off specific patterns in the data.
* Learning
  * A way to automatically find patterns and structure in data by optimizing
  the model.
  * Optimize the model to try and get the model to perform on data not in the 
  training set.
