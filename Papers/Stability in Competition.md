# Stability in Compeition (1929)

An economics paper by Harold Hotelling

### Introduction

In a dual-firm economic situation if one firm raises prices and the other keeps its prices
neutral, purchasers will slowly go from the first to the second, it will not be abrupt. This,
Hotelling states as his thesis. Using "simple mathematics" he says this can be extrapolated
to show three things
1. The existence of incomes that aren't in usual categories result from the discontinuous
increase in number of sellers
2. This system becomes inefficient leading to misplaced goods
3. A habit of imitating competitors.

This all stems from the notion that each seller is in a quasi-monopolistic position. 
(Piero Sraffa)

Duopolies, in general cases, reach an equilibrium and are not as unstable as many previously
claimed them to be.


Enter: Math
* Price is determined by a function of the quantity each seller is offering
  * p = f(q1 + q2)
* Profits are determined by seller's quantity multiplied by price
  * pro1 = q1*f(q1 + q2) AND pro2 = q2*f(q1 + q2)
* Each seller adjusts their quantity so that they maximize their profit

"discontinuities, like a vacuum, are abhurred by nature"

### Part 1

Each firm has its own tiny monopoly on its customers. Even if prices rise slightly most
buyers will continue to buy from a firm. If prices rise enough they will start to leave.

Hotelling does something interesting by packing all the costs associated with choosing one
seller over another into the distance a buyer travels to the seller. A seller, A, must
sell at a price that is lower than the price of B plus the transport cost to B, if they 
want to sell anything at all.

We get a simple equation to decribe this state where c is the unit cost of transportation

p1 + cx = p2 + cy

Solving for x and y we get

x = 1/2(l - a - b + (p2 - p1)/c), and the reverse for y where p1-p2

From this we gather that the difference in price divided by some c and added to the
distance to an opposing firm, then halved is the distance we can sell our goods.

We can derive our profit equation from this. Additionally we can take the derivative of 
our profit with respect to price to get the equation for profit maximization. This makes
a really nice graph with some sweet hyperbolas.

The results of this are many but the most interesting is that if A raises his price B may
do so as well which results in a strong duopoly. This relies on a tacit understsanding
between A and B which can fall apart if one becomes more desperate for cash. Either firm
may at any point lower their price and receive the lion's share of buyers. 

Prices may stay somewhat insucrely above their equilibrium but will not remain below
the equilibrium because it would pay instantly to raise prices. He fails to take into 
account the fact that we could beat competitors into bankruptcy if we were to keep 
prices below equillibrium long enough. HAHA just kidding, next sentence he says 
exactly what I just said.

### Part 2

It is benificial for B to approach A infinitely.

Here Hotelling gets into some pretty interesting social commentary that results from
our obersvations. Namely how wasteful a seller can be in pursuit of profit. He mentions
the sum of least squares in passing.

Sellers will become more and more like each other. Hotelling also applies this to 
political parties which is neat.
